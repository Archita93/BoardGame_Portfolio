          <h3>Thematic Background</h3>
            <p>In the heart of the picturesque Coquitlam City, a vibrant community of hikers and outdoor enthusiasts come together to embark on the legendary Coquitlam Crunch hike. This challenging trail is known for its diverse wildlife, breathtaking landscapes, and the ultimate test of endurance.
  
            In the board game Coquitlam Crunch, players assume the roles of these ambitious hikers, each with their unique backstory and motivation. From avid adventurers to weekend warriors, they gather at the trailhead, fueled by the shared goal of conquering the Coquitlam Crunch and being crowned the ultimate champion.
              
            The story world of Coquitlam comes alive as players traverse the winding paths, dense forests, and cascading streams. Along the way, they encounter a variety of wildlife, including playful raccoons, majestic bears, and stealthy coyotes. These encounters can reward them with valuable resources or challenge their physical and mental prowess.</p> 
              
            <p>  To progress along the trail, players must carefully manage their stamina tokens. Stamina stations are strategically placed throughout the hike, offering opportunities to rest, refuel, or face additional challenges to gain an advantage. The roll of the dice determines their movement, requiring tactical decision-making to conserve energy or take calculated risks for a chance to surge ahead.
              
             As the hikers approach the final stretch, the breathtaking summit awaits, offering panoramic views of the city and the satisfaction of reaching the pinnacle of their physical and mental endurance. The first player to reach the summit claims victory, but the journey itself is an accomplishment to be celebrated.</p>
              
              Coquitlam Crunch captures the spirit of the actual hike, providing an immersive experience of adventure, competition, and the beauty of nature. Players embark on an unforgettable journey, challenging their resilience, forming connections, and embracing the vibrant world of Coquitlam as they strive to become the ultimate champion of the Coquitlam Crunch.

              The Quantative Analysis document presents a comprehensive quantitative profile for our game, 
              “The Coquitlam Crunch”, using an intricate interplay between probabilities and design factors in the game.
              We tested the game and explored the possible implications of certain quantitative aspects, such as game duration, turn times, score ranges, or card distributions, in order to contribute towards achieving a balanced game.
              Such quantitative metrics demonstrate their influence and impact on the design process, leading to a more enjoyable gameplay experience for our players.

        <div>
          <p><h3>Game Dynamics</h3> 
              <p><em>Management:</em> The stamina tokens in the game are a valuable resource that players must manage strategically. Using them effectively to double dice rolls can provide a significant speed boost, but players must be careful not to deplete their stamina recklessly. There's a risk-reward element at play here, as spent stamina cards return to the random event deck and could potentially end up in opponents' hands. Plus, certain challenging terrains require stamina tokens for traversal, and players without enough stamina face penalties in the form of missed turns. Balancing the use of stamina between speed enhancement and terrain challenges is crucial.</p>
              <p><em>Encounter Management: </em>The encounter cards (wildlife and stamina stations) add an unpredictability factor to the game. Players must adapt their strategies based on the encounters drawn. For instance, some wildlife encounters might slow players down or provide them with useful resources, affecting the player's next move. On the other hand, landing on a stamina station could replenish a player's stamina tokens, allowing them to take risks with increased movement in the following turns.</p>
              
              <p><em>Strategic Sabotage: </em>The inclusion of sabotage cards adds a direct player-interaction element. Players can use sabotage cards to disrupt opponents' strategies and slow their progress. However, the timing of the sabotage is crucial. Deploying a sabotage card too early might not have as significant an impact as using it during the critical late stages of the game when the race is close. Collaborating with other players could also be an effective strategy, ganging up on a player who's significantly ahead to slow their progress and level the playing field.</p>
            </p>

          <p><h3>Trade-offs and dilemmas</h3></p>
            <p>A significant dilemma players may encounter is when to use their stamina token. These valuable tokens offer significant advantages, such as extra movement but players must decide whether to use them early in the game to gain an early lead or save them for critical moments when they face tougher terrains. The dilemma lies in finding the right balance between using stamina tokens strategically and preserving them for potentially more critical situations later in the race. Players must carefully assess the current state of the game, their position in the trail, and their opponents' progress to make the most advantageous decision. The timing of when to play these cards can significantly impact their chances of winning the game, making it a crucial and thoughtful decision.
            </p>
            <p><h3>Game Duration</h3></p>
            <p>Throughout the two playtest rotations, the average game duration fell within the range of approximately 38 to 40 minutes. Nevertheless, individual player experiences had the potential to introduce some variability in this duration.
